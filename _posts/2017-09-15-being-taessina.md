# Being taessina

_We do web business. We build mobile apps. We write beautiful code._

---

The starting five are all from engineering background. _(Yes trust us we are engineers)_.We have engineers from

* Electrical (kilovolts)
* Electronics (volts)
* Microelectronics (microvolts)
* Mechatronics (horsepower)

and now working on codes.

Started from three co-founders who believe in friendship and technology, taessina was founded with a big great vision: **contribute to the society**. The three musketeers do not want to just work to earn a living; they dream something bigger. They want to achieve financial freedom and then work on something that benefit to society.

Yes. Taessina care about the society.

We always want to give what we gained and learned back to the society: share our knowledge in programming talks, organise free programming classes, open source our projects, and create applications that help the society.

From the very beginning taessina has already cultivated its own corporate culture. We promote stress-free working environment, advocate self-development, encourage anyone to speak-up, and welcome any debate on any topic.

Being taessina is a wonderful thing, because we simply do not work 9 to 5 _(nor 8 to 6)_. We do not have a standard schedule to work, we usually define our own working time. We believe everyone has a different working time that better fits his or her life.

We believe creativity is _**indirectly proportional**_ to the stress level _(engineers, remember?)_. We encourage our staff to walk out of the office whenever they start to feel the stress: work by the pool, go to some caf√©, workout at the gym, or even take a _(long)_ nap.

"Let's go for basketball!!" said the CTO, very often. We have PS4 in the living room, as well as PS3, so we can play them anytime we want. We also have guitar as well as piano keyboard, and even have a Raspberry Pi ready for any hacking.

Wait, living room?

Yeah, because our office is a SOHO _(a L-OHO to be exact)_. We can do anything we want in there and no one is going to throw you a "this-is-inappropriate" eyesight.

Under such working culture, taessina is able to maintain its quality as well as creativity in developing software products.

So,
