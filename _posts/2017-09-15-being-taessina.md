# Being taessina

_We do web business. We build mobile apps. We write beautiful code._

---

The starting five are all from engineering background. _(Yes trust us we are engineers)_.__We have engineers from

* Electrical (kilovolts)
* Electronics (volts)
* Microelectronics (microvolts)
* Mechatronics (horsepower)

and now working on codes.

Started from three co-founders who believe in friendship and technology, taessina was founded with a big great vision: **contribute to the society**. The three musketeers do not want to just work to earn a living; they dream something bigger. They want to achieve financial freedom and then work on something that benefit to society.

Yes. Taessina care about the society.
