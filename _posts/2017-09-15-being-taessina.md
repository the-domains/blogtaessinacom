# Being taessina

_We do web business. We build mobile apps. We write beautiful code._

---

The starting five are all from engineering background. _(Yes trust us we are engineers)_.__We have engineers from

* Electrical (kilovolts)
* Electronics (volts)
* Microelectronics (microvolts)
* Mechatronics (horsepower)

and now working on codes.

Started from three co-founders who believe in friendship and technology, taessina was founded with a big great vision: **contribute to the society**. The three musketeers do not want to just work to earn a living; they dream something bigger. They want to achieve financial freedom and then work on something that benefit to society.

Yes. Taessina care about the society. 

We always want to give what we gained and learned back to the society: share our knowledge in programming talks, organise free programming classes, and create applications that help the society.
